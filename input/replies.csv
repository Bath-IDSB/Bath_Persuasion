1,You're so right. I cannot believe this police bill. It undermines all our democratic values. ,casssssssssie,1,-00:39
2,Is it tho? I think we should just be grateful we live in such a tolerant society.,M.Kapadia92,2,-00:03
3,No one is trying to take away your bloody democracy! ,FreddieBoy,3,-31:18:12

6,Whatever - I quite like the current government. Although Boris was the best #BringBackBoris,FreddieBoy,3,-24:22:12
7,Exactly - this was so important for democracy.,casssssssssie,5,-00:02

9,Tbh I'm not against vandalism. The police are the enemy!! ,KeithWayson,6,-00:15
10,You should be a photographer - you've got the lighting just right!,wiz_khaleesi,7,-27:06:59
11,They were dressed in this riot gear from the beginning. No wonder the protest turned into riots. You can't treat people like animals and expect them not to react. ,mariaann,7,-21:42:12
12,The only language the police speak is VIOLENCE,TimBJenkins,8,-00:40:00
13,What are you even fighting for? Peaceful protests are so useless - they'll never make a difference. ,mariaann,9,-39:43:12
14,Why do you hate this government and the police so much? They are just doing their best and I don't really think we should be shouting abuse at them tbh.,M.Kapadia92,9,-32:11:12

23,"20,000! What an absolute waste of time! I spent 3 hours trying to get into my office that day because it was just surrounded by these idiots. ",Harold_ff,16,-5:36:33

32,Why didn't the police officer want her picture taken?,Riyalways,22,-4:34:51
33,Bet she's one of the rotten apples!,NoahM1121,22,-4:26:41
34,Great job! I remember back in my day when we campaigned against nuclear armament - it wasn't until we peacefully protested outside the houses of parliament that the government finally began to listen. Keep it up! ,Riyalways,23,-21:19:02
35,Doing a great job what? Disrupting society? Yeah great job - the police bill passed any way so it was just a colossol waste of time. Cheers guys. Great job. ,karenM,23,-21:00:24
36,Yeah and my sister couldn't get an ambulance because these idiots were blocking the road! ,Harold_ff,23,-20:54:13

44,I can't believe this bill actually got blocked by the House of Lords! Apparently they could hear you guys in the chambers!,lavenderrrrrr,29,-18:31:44
45,No man has ever been told to 'text me when you get home'. Peaceful protests with such moving words on signs are the best way of sending a message.,lavenderrrrrr,31,-24:25:12
46,You can't blame all police for Sarah Everard though. It was just a rotten apple - and he's been punished. ,FreddieBoy,31,-24:12:10
47,Eurgh I'm so sick of people saying that. The met police are all rotten! ,tastyrobot,31,-24:00:35

56,I'm not normally concerned about health and safety but those candles really shouldn't be that close to that paper! ,Thelma77,40,-7:00:31
57,How many more protests do we need to have before the met police sorts its game out! Lives are being lost!!,kittycatbakes,40,-6:30:34
58,Looks like there was a high police presence? Not really sure why given it was a peaceful protest.,wiz_khaleesi,42,-4:12:58
59,I applied for the met police once but they rejected my application. Now I'm so glad I'm not a police officer! ,LucieLoo,43,-1:34:12

67,That's so sad. Thinking about what the women of this country have to put up with is just disgusting. I can't believe the met police's reaction as well - telling people to flag down a bus. Absolute crap. This was a fantastic vigil though. Really sent the message that enough is enough. ,LucieLoo,53,-0:32:05
68,"I just don't get why they needed so many police there? It's not like things were going to get out of hand, it's a vigil ffs. Tbh, I think we need to take stronger action against the police. These peaceful protests and vigils just aren't enough anymore. We need to fight back. ",Sharon111,55,-1:32:04
69,Sarah was absolutely robbed of her freedom. She was so young and she had so much life ahead of her. I can't believe what that police officer did. And all the things about him being nicknamed 'the rapist'. They knew. The police knew he was a wrong'un and they did nothing. It makes me SICK. ,Riyalways,55,-1:17:19

72,"Fuck the pigs! All cops are bastards! Tbh I think we should bring back the death penalty for Wayne Couzens, what he did was actually sickening. He abused his power and the met did nothing. Fuck em. We should be rioting not having peaceful vigils. ",Sharon111,61,-25:46:53
73,#IamSarah and I am scared to leave my home on my own. I'm scared to walk around and I'm scared to trust those who are supposed to protect us. This was such a beautiful vigil but I am just so scared 😭 It is so unfair that I know my brothers don't walk around with their keys in their hands and their rape alarms ready. ,caffeinated,62,-15:05:43
